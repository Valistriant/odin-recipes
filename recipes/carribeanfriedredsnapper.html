    <h4>Caribbean Fried Red Snapper is a vibrant and flavorful dish where whole red snapper is seasoned with a blend of Caribbean spices and fried until crispy. To make it, start by cleaning and scaling the red snapper, then season it generously with a mixture of garlic, thyme, paprika, and salt. Heat oil in a pan and dredge the fish in flour before frying until golden brown and crispy on both sides. Serve with a squeeze of lime and a side of fresh salsa or a tangy salad. This dish captures the essence of Caribbean cuisine with its bold flavors and crispy texture.</h4>

  <h4>How the hell do we cook this thing?!</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Clean and scale the whole red snapper, then pat dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix minced garlic, chopped thyme, paprika, salt, and black pepper to create a seasoning blend.</li>
    <li>Rub the seasoning mixture all over the fish, making sure to get some inside the cavity and score the flesh lightly with a knife.</li>
    <li>Place flour in a shallow dish and dredge the seasoned fish on both sides until well-coated.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until hot (about 350°F or 175°C).</li>
    <li>Carefully place the dredged fish into the hot oil and fry for 4-6 minutes per side, or until the fish is golden brown and crispy. Ensure the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.</li>
    <li>Remove the fish from the pan and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
    <li>Serve the fried red snapper hot, with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the fish.</li>
  </ol>

    <h4>Mashed potatoes are a classic comfort food made from boiled potatoes that are mashed until smooth and creamy. To prepare them, start by peeling and cutting potatoes into even chunks, then boil them in salted water until tender. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot, then mash with a potato masher or ricer. Stir in butter and milk (or cream) to achieve a rich, smooth consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste. For extra flavor, you can add garlic, chives, or cheese if desired.</h4>
